Django HTTP Proxy
=================

Django HTTP Proxy provides simple HTTP proxy functionality for the Django web
development framework.

Motivation
----------

One possible use for this application (actually, the reason it was developed)
is to allow for easy development of Ajax applications against a live server
environment. 

The built-in `Django development server <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#runserver>`_
already makes Django a wonderful tool for front-end developers needing a quick
way to set up a HTTP server. Now, with
`Django HTTP Proxy <http://bitbucket.org/yvandermeer/django-http-proxy/>`_ you
can seamlessly integrate your front-end work with a live back-end. No more
ugly PHP proxy scripts, and no more "standalone" vs "integrated" switches in a
client-side Communication Controller (unless you really want to of course!).

For instance, you might be developing an Ajax application which end up running
in an JSP environment. Instead of having to deploy your application on the JSP
server, you can already test against against the live server environment while
you develop. All you need is the Django framework, run `manage.py` and you are
good to go.

Installation
